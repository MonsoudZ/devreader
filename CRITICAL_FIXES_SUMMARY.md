# DevReader Critical Fixes Summary

## üö® **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **WebKit Process Crashes**
**Problem**: WebKit processes were crashing with errors like:
```
Error acquiring assertion: <Error Domain=RBSServiceErrorDomain Code=1 "(target is not running or doesn't have entitlement com.apple.runningboard.assertions.webkit AND originator doesn't have entitlement com.apple.runningboard.assertions.webkit)">
```

**Solution**: 
- Created `DevReader.entitlements` file with proper sandbox entitlements
- Updated project settings to use `readwrite` instead of `readonly` for file access
- Added `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS = DevReader.entitlements` to build settings
- Improved WebView configuration with proper process pool management

### 2. **Save Panel Permissions**
**Problem**: App couldn't display save panels due to missing write entitlements:
```
Unable to display save panel: your app has the User Selected File Read entitlement but it needs User Selected File Read/Write to display save panels.
```

**Solution**:
- Added `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write` entitlement
- Added `com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write` entitlement
- Added temporary exceptions for common file paths

### 3. **WebView Configuration Issues**
**Problem**: WebKit processes were unstable and crashing

**Solution**:
- Simplified WebView configuration to use standard APIs
- Added proper process pool management
- Improved error handling in WebView delegates
- Added accessibility support

## üìÅ **Files Modified**

### New Files:
- `DevReader.entitlements` - Sandbox entitlements configuration

### Modified Files:
- `DevReader.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Updated build settings and added entitlements
- `Views/Web/WebPane.swift` - Improved WebView configuration
- `Views/Code/CodePane.swift` - Improved WebView configuration

## ‚úÖ **Results**

1. **Build Success**: App now builds without errors
2. **WebKit Stability**: No more process crashes
3. **File Operations**: Save panels now work correctly
4. **All Tests Pass**: Unit tests, performance tests, and accessibility tests all passing
5. **App Launch**: App launches successfully without errors

## üîß **Technical Details**

### Entitlements Added:
```xml
